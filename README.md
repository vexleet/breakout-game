Breakout game inspired from "https://developer.mozilla.org"

Breakout game wrote by me with help from "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Games/Tutorials/2D_Breakout_game_pure_JavaScript"
The project is written in order to educate myself of using <canvas> and I learned a lot of things from this article. 
I hope I can do future projects using <canvas> and I recommend reading this article.

## How to play ?
* The game is really simple all you have to do is move the paddle to hit the ball
* The main goal is to not let the ball hit the bottom wall of the screen and watch it break the bricks
* The game contains 3 levels and each level the ball is getting faster and there are more bricks to break
